# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis Project
Resources: pgAdmin (PostgreSQL)
## Overview of the Analysis
With the upcoming "Silver Tsunami" occurring in many industries, Pewlett-Hackard wanted to get ahead of this by planning for retirement. From the start of the project, it was obvious that thousands of employees were set to retire in the next few years, setting the company up for a big shift from knowledgable and experienced employees to younger talent. Managers from the Sales and Development departments came up with an idea to have the older employees mentor some of the existing employees to fill their positions. Our job was to upload the 6 CSV files that had all of their company information to a database in pgAdmin, and then sort through the data to find employees who would be eligible to help in the mentorship program.

## Results
Below were the major findings from the two deliverables in this project:
- Over 90,000 employees will be retiring in the next few years.
- Of those 90,000, 29,414 are Senior Engineers, 28,254 are Senior Staff, 14,222 are Engineers, and 12,243 are Staff. With over 50,000 Senior employees and over 40,000 of both total engineers and staff retiring soon, the mentorship program should focus on training staff and engineers of all levels more than other positions down the list.
- Most of the employees have worked with Pewlett-Hackard for at least 20 years, so they will be very knowledgable on the history of the company. Some have even moved up into more senior roles while working here, which means that they will be great candidates for teaching new ambitious employees.
- Of those retiring, we found 1,549 candidates who are eligible to be in the mentorship program.
